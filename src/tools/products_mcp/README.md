# MCP Server with product tools

FastAPI-based MCP implementation that exposes product catalog utilities to the Azure AI Foundry agents. It surfaces endpoints for vector search, pricing, stock, and ranking while enforcing the shared problem-details error contract.

The server talks to Cosmos DB (vector index + transactional data) via managed identity and adheres to the private networking modelâ€”only agent service identities inside the VNet can reach it. Logging captures tool latency, response sizes, and correlation IDs for the platform observability story.
